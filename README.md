# CITES Wildlife Trade Data Visualisation

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or CITES for short, is an international treaty organization tasked with monitoring, reporting, and providing recommendations on the international species trade.
This dataset contains records on every international legal import or export conducted with species from the CITES. 
It contains columns identifying the species, the import and export countries, and the amount and characteristics of the goods being traded (which range from live animals to skins and cadavers).
